# Chemical Encoder
Program that transforms a string into elements of the periodic table.

# How it works
The program will read two characters, if they exist in the table it writes their atomic number, if not, it sees if the first character of those two characters exists, if so it writes it, and so on.

# To start
Just run the encrypt.py or encrypt.exe
